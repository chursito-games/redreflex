    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy describes how <strong>Red Reflex</strong> handles information
      when you use the website.

    <h2>Information we collect</h2>

    <p>
      Red Reflex does not require users to create accounts and does not collect
      personally identifiable information such as names, addresses, or phone numbers.
    </p>

    <p>
      The game may store limited data locally in your browser (for example,
      reaction time scores or personal bests) to improve your experience.
      This data is stored using browser technologies such as localStorage
      and is not transmitted to our servers.

    <h2>Analytics and advertising</h2>

    <p>
      We may use third-party analytics services to understand how visitors
      interact with the site. These services may collect anonymized information
      such as browser type, device, or approximate location.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the future, Red Reflex may display advertisements provided by Google AdSense
      or similar services. These providers may use cookies or similar technologies
      to show relevant ads.
    </p>

    <h2>Third-party policies</h2>

    <p>
      Third-party services have their own privacy policies. We encourage users
      to review those policies for more information about how their data is handled.
