    <h1>About Red Reflex</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Red Reflex</strong> is a simple reaction time test designed to measure
      how fast you can respond to a visual signal. When the screen turns red,
      your only goal is to tap or click as quickly as possible.
    </p>

    <p>
      The idea is intentionally minimal. No accounts, no upgrades, no distractions.
      Just raw reaction speed. Each run consists of five rounds, encouraging you
      to improve your timing and beat your own personal best.
    </p>

    <h2>Why Red Reflex exists</h2>

    <p>
      Red Reflex was created as a lightweight, browser-based game that anyone can play
      instantly on desktop or mobile. It focuses on short sessions that are easy to repeat,
      making it perfect for quick challenges, casual competition with friends,
      or simply testing your reflexes.
    </p>

    <p>
      Reaction time tests are commonly used in gaming, sports training,
      and cognitive exercises. Red Reflex offers a clean and accessible version
      of that concept, without unnecessary complexity.
    </p>

    <p>
      Red Reflex does not require registration and does not collect personal information
      such as names or email addresses. Some basic data may be stored locally
      in your browser (for example, your personal best score).
